# Mega-Cheat
Condensed Mega Cheat Sheet

## About:
This is not intended to be an all-inclusive cheat sheet, but instead a personal reference for things I need to see fairly consistently. This is a living document.

## Status:
- Refurbish taking place on modular-responsive branch
- Syntax highlighting would be nice
- Drag and drop reorientation of sections + JSON save to local storage?

## Log:
- 5.3-5.19: Work Day - no time for coding
- 5.2.19: Big div restructure and color coding, more work to b e done on it yet
