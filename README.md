# Mega-Cheat
Condensed Mega Cheat Sheet

The plan for this is just to make myself a cheat sheet of the major things I have to recall on a daily basis. I'm intentionally building it with a monitor in mind, not a tiny mobile device. I work on a computer, not a smart phone - so maximizing viewscreen real estate is the name of the game. No massive padding, huge margins, or awkwardly large text to make it look nice on mobile is necessary for this one.
